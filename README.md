# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This application is a simple calendar that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. It is meant to act as a daily planner with features including color coding that makes it easy and user friendly for users to plan their day. Making this application made me more familiar with jquery and also local storage.

To begin you will see empty slots where you can type a description for what you plan to do! If the time block is grey it is in the past, if it is red it is the current hour and if it is green that is the future.

Add your plans for the day and hit the blue save button on the right to save the description. Now you can refresh the page and the items will still be there!
